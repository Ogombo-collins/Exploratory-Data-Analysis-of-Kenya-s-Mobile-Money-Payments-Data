## Mobile Money Payments

Mobile money payment is a system of paying for goods and services, and sending money to friends and family members using a portable electronic device like PDAs (smartphones and tablets). Mobile money payments services are commonly offered by mobile network providers and third party providers contracted by banks. 

Anyone armed with a phone can open a money wallet which will be used to store value (money) that can be exchanged for goods and services.

Majority of mobile money services allow receiving and sending money to peers, as well storing it in a virtual wallet on your mobile device or withdrawing and depositing at licenced agents. 

According to a report by **Statista**, mobile wallets such as PayPal, Apple Pay, and Alipay are the most widely used mobile payment methods globally.
